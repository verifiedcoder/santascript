# SANTA SCRIPT

Santa's Workshop runs on some pretty gnarly code.

This repository contains the scripting runtime for Santa's Workshop. It is extremely lagacy, reflecting the enormous amount of time it has been in production.

To say it has issues, is a minor understatement! Do the elves really know how it works? Absolutely not! Does it work every time? What do you think!?

Regardless, here it is, open-sourced by the IT Department for Santa's Workshop at the North Pole.

Confused? Scratchign your head? Tears forming? Never fear, the example .santa script will get you going. Maybe.

# SANTA SCRIPT Specification

This **SANTA SCRIPT Specification** reflects the latest version of the core files (`santa_lexer.py`, `santa_parser.py`, `santa_runtime.py`, and `santa.py`). 

---

## Part 1: Core Language Features

```text
# Files must end in .santa
# Character encoding must be UTF-8
# Files should not have unsupported "magic cookie crumbs" in the header
```

### 2. Complete Data Types
```text
WRAP variableName AS type

Types:

IT Department note: Please, please, do not take this too seriously. We're all far too busy getting everything ready for next year, so we can't accept issues, pull requests, etc. Maybe it's better that way...

Start a virtual environment, maybe add any packages needed and HO! HO! HO!

If the repository is freshly cloned and doesnâ€™t have a `.venv`, follow these steps to set up and start a Python virtual environment:

---

### **1. Create a New Virtual Environment**
Run the following command in the root of your project directory:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

- This will create a folder named `.venv` in your project directory.
- The `.venv` folder contains the isolated Python environment.

---

### **2. Activate the Virtual Environment**

#### On **Windows**:
Run:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On **macOS/Linux**:
Run:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- Once activated, your terminal prompt will change to include `(.venv)`.

---

### **3. Install Project Dependencies**
If the repository includes a dependency file (like `requirements.txt`), install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all the dependencies needed for the project.

---

### **4. Verify the Setup**
Check that the virtual environment is active and the dependencies are installed:

1. Run:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   - This should show the Python version inside the virtual environment.

2. Verify installed dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip list
   ```
   - This will list all installed packages in the virtual environment.

---

### **5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment (When Done)**
When youâ€™re finished working in the virtual environment, deactivate it by running:

```bash
deactivate
```

This will return you to the system Python environment.
